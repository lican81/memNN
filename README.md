# memNN
A neural network framework for running with memristor crossbar.

This code is partly to support the LSTM experiment in the submitted manuscript: 

Li, C. et al, Long short-term memory networks in memristor crossbars, preprint available at: https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11801

# SYSTEM REQUIREMENT
The codes have been tested on the following operation system, but they should support other OS.
Windows 10;
Mac OS X, 10.13.4

The code was tested on:
Mathworks Matlab R2017b


# INSTALLATION GUIDE
Installation not required.

# DEMO
Run the script in 'demo' folder.
The codes that interface the hardware is not provided. 

# INSTRUCTION
The real_array backend are dependent on the measurement system and hardware. 
The experimental data will be provided upon reasonable request.
